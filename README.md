## About the Project ##



## AI on the Edge ##


<img src="https://github.com/Karthikkannan-AI/Traffic-Management-AI/blob/main/resources/Industrial%20AI.png">

Edge AI is a system that uses Deep Learning algorithms to process data generated by a hardware device at the local level. The device does not need to be connected to the Internet to process such data and make decisions in real time, in a matter of milliseconds. This considerably reduces the communication costs derived from the cloud model. 

__EDGE AI AND INDUSTRY 4.0__

Industry 4.0 is about creating a ‘smart factory’, a manufacturing site that utilizes data from various types of sensors and all the available sources in order to optimize the processes. Computer Vision powered by EDGE AI is a part of a complex approach to smart manufacturing that allows computers and machines to ‘see’ the physical world by enabling them to extract, process, and analyse information from visual inputs.

### Application Usecases of Computer Vision powered by EDGE AI ###

| Application | Overview |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Predictive Maintenance | Using machine learning and IoT devices to monitor data on machinery and components, often using sensors, to collect data points and identify signals or take corrective actions before assets or components break down. |
| Package Inspection | Product Identification & Counting |
| Reading Barcodes | Identifying and processing hundreds and thousands of barcodes per day in the production line. |
| Product and Components Assembly | Computer vision allows manufacturers to inspect products in a full 360-degree view to ensure that products are placed in the correct packaging and is also able to inspect other critical attributes of packaged products such as: Cap closure/seal Position Label Print quality and much more! |
| Safety Inspection | Apply deep learning-based artificial intelligence to track people and predict the movement of equipment to help avoid dangerous interactions thereby improving safety. |
| Track and Trace | Using computer vision to identify the Product serial numbers, expiration dates, manufacturing dates. |
| Defect Reduction | Identifies defects and stores images and accompanying metadata related to the image.  As items fall through the production line, defects get classified according to their type and are assigned an accompanying grade. |

## Rebounding from COVID-19 ##

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly influenced the lives of most people on the planet.

Like every business across the World, we too got impacted and affected by Coronavirus.

We are navigating the business impact of Covid-19 through self-motivation and Innovation.

This work is part of our journey towards Recovery and Reinvention.
