## Introduction ##

Traffic jams in Indian cities aren’t just frustrating – they’re also expensive
Congestion in the four biggest cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata)  is costing $22 billion annually(As per the report from The Boston Consulting Group and commissioned by Uber).

Peak-hour congestion, which implies the additional time taken during peak traffic to travel a given distance, in these four Indian cities is estimated at 149%, much higher than the Asian average of 67%.

The cost of congestion was calculated on the basis of fuel burned and productivity loss, which includes the man-hours and opportunity cost, pollution, and accidents (health costs) incurred on an annual basis.


## Smart Cities Mission ##

National Smart Cities Mission is an urban renewal and retrofitting program by the Government of India with the mission to develop smart cities across the country, making them citizen-friendly and sustainable. The Union Ministry of Urban Development is responsible for implementing the mission in collaboration with the state governments of the respective cities. The mission initially included 100 cities, with the deadline for completion of the projects set between 2019 and 2023.

## AI on the Edge (CCTV) ##

Edge AI is a system that uses Deep Learning algorithms to process data generated by a hardware device(CCTV) at the local level. The device does not need to be connected to the Internet to process such data and make decisions in real-time, in a matter of milliseconds. This considerably reduces the communication costs derived from the cloud model.

## The Problem ##

<img src = "https://github.com/Karthikkannan-AI/Traffic-Management-AI/blob/main/resources/Problem.jpg" width= "60%">

### Analysis of the Problem ###

Most of the traffic management systems available in India today are not automated and prone to human errors.

Traffic monitoring in India is the biggest concern, due to overcrowding, increasing daily commuters, shortened or narrow roads. All the above factors lead to congestion.

Traffic congestion leads to 
* Pollution and global warming that affect the internal city environment. 
* Long waiting hours in traffic is an expensive deal for commuters due to high fuel consumption. 
* Operating better road networks for free traffic flow has a direct impact on the productivity of the economy.

__Smart traffic management system goal__: Prioritize traffic conditions by analysing real-time traffic situations.
