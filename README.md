## Introduction ##

## AI on the Edge ##

Edge AI is a system that uses Deep Learning algorithms to process data generated by a hardware device at the local level. The device does not need to be connected to the Internet to process such data and make decisions in real time, in a matter of milliseconds. This considerably reduces the communication costs derived from the cloud model.

### Analysis of the Problem ###

__WHY INDIA DESPERATELY NEEDS AI POWERED TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT__

Most of the traffic management systems available in India today are not automated and prone to human errors.

Traffic monitoring in India is the biggest concern, due to overcrowding, increasing daily commuters,, shortened or narrow roads. All the above factors leads to congestion.

Traffic congestion leads to 
* Pollution and global warming that affect the internal city environment. 
* Long waiting hours in traffic is an expensive deal for commuters due to high fuel consumption. 
* Operating better road networks for free traffic flow has a direct impact on the productivity of the economy.

__Smart traffic management system goal__: Prioritize traffic conditions by analysing real-time traffic situations.
